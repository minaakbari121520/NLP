        "Some examples of use cases for `tf-models-official` include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Image Classification:** You can use pre-trained models such as EfficientNet, ResNet, or MobileNet to classify images into different categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Object Detection:** The package includes models like SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet that can detect and localize objects in images or videos.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Text Classification:** With models like BERT or Transformer, you can perform sentiment analysis, text categorization, or other text classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Semantic Segmentation:** Using models like DeepLab, you can segment images at a pixel level, distinguishing different objects or regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By installing `tf-models-official`, you gain access to these models and utilities, which can save you time and effort in developing and deploying machine learning solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that after installing the package, you may need to import specific modules or classes from it to use them in your code. The package documentation and examples can provide further guidance on how to leverage its functionality effectively.\n",

        "- `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library, which is an open-source machine learning framework. It provides various tools and functions for building and training neural networks.\n",
        "- `import tensorflow_hub as hub`: TensorFlow Hub is a library that provides pre-trained models and modules for TensorFlow. It allows easy integration of pre-trained models into new projects.\n",
        "- `import tensorflow_text as text`: TensorFlow Text is an extension library for text processing with TensorFlow. It provides functions and tools for preprocessing and handling textual data.\n",
        "- `from official.nlp import optimization`: This import statement is specific to the TensorFlow official models repository and imports the optimization module. It provides the AdamW optimizer, which is an extension of the Adam optimizer.\n",

It seems to be the initial setup phase, where necessary libraries and modules are imported and configured. Without further code, it is not possible to determine the specific tasks or functionality this code is intended for.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's worth noting that TensorFlow is a powerful library for machine learning and NLP tasks. The imported modules like TensorFlow Hub and TensorFlow Text indicate that the code might be related to NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or text generation. TensorFlow provides a wide range of functionality for building and training neural networks, and the additional imported modules extend its capabilities in the context of text processing.\n",
